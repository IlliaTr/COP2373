Description:
This program collects student exam scores, writes them to a CSV file, and reads the file to display the scores in a formatted manner. 
It involves two primary functions: one for writing scores to the CSV and another for reading and displaying the scores.

Variables:
- num_students: Integer representing the number of students whose data will be entered.
- filename: String representing the name of the CSV file where data is stored ('grades.csv').
- first_name, last_name: Strings for storing the student's first and last names.
- exam1, exam2, exam3: Integers for storing the scores of three exams.

Functions:
- write_grades(): This function collects data about students and their exam scores, then writes this data to a CSV file.
- read_grades(): This function reads the student data from the CSV file and prints it in a formatted manner.

Logical Steps:
- Define function write_grades:
    Ask the user for number of students
    Open 'grades.csv' in write mode
    Write header row to CSV file
    For each student in the range of number of students:
        Prompt user for student's first and last name
        Prompt user for Exam 1, 2, and 3 scores
        Write the student data as a new row in the CSV file
    Close the CSV file
- Define function read_grades:
    Open 'grades.csv' in read mode
    Read header row from the CSV file
    Display formatted header
    For each row in the CSV file:
        Print formatted student data row
    Close the CSV file
- Execute the main and read blocks.
