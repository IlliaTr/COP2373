Description:
This program performs a cinema ticket pre-sale application. It allows users to pre-purchase cinema tickets with a limit of 4 tickets per buyer and a total of 20 tickets available for sale.

Variables:
- total_tickets: Stores the total number of tickets available for sale.
- max_tickets_per_buyer: Stores the maximum number of tickets a buyer can purchase.
- total_buyers: Accumulator variable to keep track of the total number of buyers.

Functions:
- pre_sell_tickets(): Main function to manage the pre-sale of cinema tickets.

Logical Steps:
1. Initialize the total_tickets to 20 and max_tickets_per_buyer to 4.
2. Initialize total_buyers to 0.
3. Use a while loop to continue the ticket sale process until all tickets are sold.
4. Prompt the user for the desired number of tickets.
5. Validate the input:
   - Ensure the number of tickets requested is between 1 and 4.
   - Ensure the number of tickets requested does not exceed the remaining tickets.
6. If the input is valid, update the total_tickets and increment total_buyers.
7. Display the remaining number of tickets.
8. When all tickets are sold, exit the loop and display the total number of buyers.
