Description:
This program allows the user to input a list of their monthly expenses, 
including the type and amount of each expense. 
The program then calculates the total expense, the highest expense, 
and the lowest expense using the `reduce` and lambda functions and finally displays the results.

Variables:
- expenses: List of tuples to store the type and amount of each expense.
- expense_type: String to store the type of each expense entered by the user.
- amount: Float to store the amount of each expense entered by the user.
- total_expense: Float to store the total amount of expenses.
- highest_expense: Tuple to store the type and amount of the highest expense.
- lowest_expense: Tuple to store the type and amount of the lowest expense.

Functions:
- main(): Handles user input, performs calculations, and displays results.

Logical Steps:
1. Import the functools library for the reduce function.
2. Define the main function.
3. Initialize an empty list to store expenses.
4. Prompt the user to enter the type and amount of each expense until they type 'f'.
5. Use the reduce function with a lambda to calculate the total expense.
6. Use the reduce function with a lambda to find the highest expense.
7. Use the reduce function with a lambda to find the lowest expense.
8. Display the total expense, highest expense, and lowest expense with appropriate labels.
9. Call the main function to run the program.
