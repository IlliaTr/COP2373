Description:
This program calculates the length of the hypotenuse of a right triangle when provided with the nearest angle (in degrees) and the length of the adjacent side. The program uses trigonometric functions to perform the calculation.

Variables:

- angle_degrees: A float representing the nearest angle in degrees.
- adjacent_length: A float representing the length of the adjacent side.
- angle_radians: A float representing the nearest angle in radians (converted from degrees).
- hypotenuse_length: A float representing the calculated length of the hypotenuse.

Functions:

- get_user_input(): Prompts the user to input the nearest angle in degrees and the length of the adjacent side.
- calculate_hypotenuse(angle_degrees, adjacent_length): Converts the angle from degrees to radians using the cosine function to calculate the length of the hypotenuse.
- main(): Main function to execute the program logic. It gets user input, calculates the hypotenuse length, and displays the result.

Logical Steps

- User Input
  The program prompts the user to enter the nearest angle in degrees and the length of the adjacent side.
  The user inputs are read and stored as angle_degrees and adjacent_length.

- Convert Angle to Radians
  The program converts the angle from degrees to radians using the formula: angle_radians = angle_degrees \* (pi / 180).

- Calculate Hypotenuse
  The program calculates the hypotenuse length using the cosine function: hypotenuse_length = adjacent_length / cos(angle_radians).

- Display Result
  The program displays the calculated length of the hypotenuse.
