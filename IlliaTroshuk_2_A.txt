Description:
This program checks an email message for common spam keywords and phrases.
It then assigns a "spam score" based on the number of keywords found, and indicates the likelihood that the message is spam.

Variables:
- spam_keywords: a list containing common spam keywords and phrases.
- email_message: a string that holds the email message entered by the user.
- spam_score: an integer that tracks the number of spam keywords found.
- spam_words_found: a list that contains the spam keywords found in the email message.
- likelihood: a string indicating the likelihood that the message is spam.

Functions:
- main(): the main function that executes the program.

Logical Steps:
1. Define a list of common spam keywords and phrases.
2. Ask the user to enter an email message.
3. Convert the email message to lowercase to ensure case-insensitive matching.
4. Initialize likelihood string, spam_score to 0 and spam_words_found to an empty list.
5. Iterate over each keyword in spam_keywords.
   - Use regular expressions to check if the keyword is in the email message.
   - If a keyword is found, increment spam_score and add the keyword to spam_words_found.
6. Determine the likelihood of the email being spam based on spam_score:
   - High: if spam_score is greater than 6
   - Moderate: if spam_score is between 3 and 6
   - Low: if spam_score is 3 or less
7. Display the spam score, likelihood, and keywords found to the user.
