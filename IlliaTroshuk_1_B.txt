Description:
This program simulates a Magic 8 Ball, a fortune telling toy that provides random responses to yes or no questions. 
The program creates a file called 8ball_responses.txt with a list of predefined responses. 
Then, it reads the responses from the file, prompts the user to ask a question, and displays a random response. 
The user can continue asking questions until they choose to quit (respond no.)

Variables:
- responses: List to store the Magic 8 Ball responses.

Functions:
1. create_responses_file(): Creates the file 8ball_responses.txt and writes predefined responses to it.
2. read_responses(): Reads responses from the file into a list.
3. magic_8_ball(): Simulates the Magic 8 Ball by prompting the user to ask a question and displaying a random response.

Logical Steps:
1. Call create_responses_file() to generate the file with predefined responses.
2. Call read_responses() to read responses from the file into a list.
3. Start a loop to simulate the Magic 8 Ball:
    a. Prompt the user to ask a yes/no type question.
    b. Display a random response from the list of responses.
    c. Ask the user if they want to ask another question.
    d. If the user chooses to quit, exit the loop.
