Description:
This program simulates a Poker game where the user is dealt a hand of five cards. The user can then choose to replace some of the cards, and the program will deal new cards for the chosen positions.

Variables:

- self.card_list: A list containing card identifiers.
- self.current_card: An integer representing the index of the current card to be dealt.
- self.size: An integer representing the total number of cards in the deck.
- deck: An instance of the Deck class.
- hand: A list containing the current cards in the player's hand.
- indices: A list of integers representing the positions of the cards the user wants to replace.

Functions:

- **init**(self, size): Initializes the deck with a specified size, shuffles the cards, and sets the current card index to 0.
- deal(self): Deals a card from the deck. If all cards have been dealt, reshuffles the deck and resets the current card index.
- deal_initial_hand(deck): Deals an initial hand of five cards from the deck.
- replace_cards(deck, hand, indices): Replaces specified cards in the hand with new cards from the deck.
- get_user_input(): Prompts the user to enter the positions of the cards they want to replace.
- main(): Main function to execute the game logic. It initializes the deck, deals the initial hand, prompts the user to replace cards, and displays the final hand.

Logical Steps:

- Initialization
  The program initializes a deck of cards with a specified size. The size is set to 52 for more frequent reshuffling during testing.

- Dealing Initial Hand
  The program deals an initial hand of five cards from the deck using the deal_initial_hand(deck) function. The dealt cards are displayed to the user with their positions.

- User Input
  The user is prompted to enter the positions of the cards they want to replace. The positions should be entered as a comma-separated string.
  The input is processed and converted into a list of integers.

- Replacing Cards
  The specified cards in the user's hand are replaced with new cards from the deck using the replace_cards(deck, hand, indices) function.
  The updated hand is displayed to the user.

- Reshuffling Deck
  If all cards have been dealt from the deck, the deck is reshuffled automatically. The program prints a message indicating that reshuffling has occurred.

- End of Program
  The program ends after displaying the user's final hand.
