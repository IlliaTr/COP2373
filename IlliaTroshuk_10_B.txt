Description:
The BankAcct class represents a bank account, inheriting from the Money class. This class supports various 
operations such as depositing, withdrawing, adjusting interest rates, and calculating interest. The Money 
class, inherited from Decimal, provides arithmetic operations and ensures that the currency unit is consistent 
across operations.

Variables:
- name: The account holder's name.
- account_number: The account number.
- amount: The current balance of the account, stored as a Money object.
- interest_rate: The interest rate applied to the account.

Methods:
- __init__(self, name, account_number, amount=0.0, interest_rate=0.01): Initializes the BankAcct object.
- adjust_interest_rate(self, new_rate): Adjusts the interest rate of the account.
- deposit(self, amount): Deposits money into the account using the add method from the Money class.
- withdraw(self, amount): Withdraws money from the account using the subtract method from the Money class.
- balance(self): Returns the current balance of the account.
- calculate_interest(self, days): Calculates interest earned over a specified number of days.
- __str__(self): Returns a string representation of the account details.

Logical Steps:
- Initialization:
The __init__ method initializes the account holder's name, account number, initial amount, and interest rate.
The initial amount is converted to a Money object.

- Adjusting Interest Rate:
The adjust_interest_rate method sets a new interest rate for the account.

- Depositing Money:
The deposit method creates a Money object for the deposit amount and adds it to the current balance.

- Withdrawing Money:
The withdraw method creates a Money object for the withdrawal amount and subtracts it from the current balance.

- Checking Balance:
The balance method returns the current balance as a Money object.

- Calculating Interest:
The calculate_interest method calculates the interest earned over a specified number of days, returning a Money 
object representing the interest.

- String Representation:
The __str__ method provides a formatted string with the account details.

- Testing:
The test_bank_acct function creates a BankAcct object and tests various operations including deposit, withdrawal, 
adjusting interest rates, and calculating interest.
