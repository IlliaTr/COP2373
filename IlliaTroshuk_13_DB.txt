Description:
This program creates a SQLite database to store population data for 10 cities in Florida for the year 2023. It simulates a 2% annual population growth for the next 20 years and visualizes the growth for a user-selected city using matplotlib.

Variables:

- db_name: Name of the SQLite database.
- cities: List of cities in Florida.
- initial_population: List of initial population values for the cities in 2023.

Functions:

- simulate_population_growth(years=20, growth_rate=0.02): Simulates population growth for the specified number of years at a given growth rate.
- plot_population_growth(): Plots the population growth for a selected city using matplotlib.

Logical Steps:
Database Setup

- Connect to Database: Establishs a connection to a SQLite database named population_IT.db.
- Create Table: Checks if a table named population exists in the database; if not, creates it with columns for city, year, and population.

Data Insertion

- Define Cities and Initial Populations: Lists 10 cities in Florida and their corresponding populations for the year 2023.
- Insert Initial Data: Populates the population table with the initial data for each city for the year 2023.

Population Growth Simulation

- Define Growth Function: Creates a function simulate_population_growth to simulate a 2% annual growth rate for 20 years.
- Calculate Future Populations: For each city, calculates the population for the years 2024 through 2043 using the formula: new_population = last_population \* (1 + growth_rate).
- Insert Future Data: Inserts the calculated population data for each year into the database.

Data Visualization

- Prompt User for City Selection: Displays the list of cities and prompts the user to select one for visualization.
- Fetch Population Data: Retrieves the population data for the selected city from the database.
- Plot Data: Uses matplotlib to create a line plot showing the population growth over time for the selected city.
- Display Plot: Shows the plot to the user, visualizing the trend of population growth.

Cleanup

- Close Database Connection: Ensures that the database connection is properly closed after all operations are completed.
